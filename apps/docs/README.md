# docs

The gitmatter documentation site — a standalone **Next.js + Fumadocs** app, built
with its own toolchain (independent of the `apps/web` vite-plus build) and served
under `/docs`.

## Why a separate app

Docs build and deploy on their own (`next build`), so they don't depend on the main
app's build pipeline. Content is plain MDX in the repo-root `docs/` folder (the
single source of truth); this app only renders it — see `source.config.ts` (`dir:
"../../docs"`).

## Commands

```bash
# from repo root
bun run docs:build      # turbo run build --filter=docs
bun run docs:dev        # dev server on http://localhost:4285/docs

# or from apps/docs
bun run build           # next build → standalone server output
bun run dev             # next dev  (http://localhost:4285/docs)
```

## Serving in production

`bun run docs:build` (or `next build`) produces a self-contained standalone server.
The build's postbuild step copies `.next/static` and the repo-root `docs/` into the
standalone output (to `.next/standalone/docs`), so the whole `.next/standalone`
directory is deployable as-is. Run it and reverse-proxy `/docs` to it:

```bash
node apps/docs/.next/standalone/apps/docs/server.js   # listens on PORT (default 3000)
```

Updating docs is a rebuild: edit `docs/**` (repo root), run `bun run docs:build`, redeploy.

`basePath` is `/docs`, so every route and asset is namespaced under `/docs`
(`/docs/_next/...`, `/docs/api/search`, `/docs/llms.txt`). A single reverse-proxy
rule routes everything to this app:

```
location /docs { proxy_pass http://docs-app; }
```

This avoids any collision with `apps/web`'s own `/api/*` routes.

## What's here

- repo-root `docs/**` — the MDX content (Getting started, User manual, User guide,
  AI & agents, API reference, Admin & compliance) + `meta.json` sidebar ordering.
  This app renders it via `source.config.ts` (`dir: "../../docs"`).
- `app/(docs)/[[...slug]]` — renders a page with fumadocs `DocsLayout`/`DocsPage`,
  including the copy-for-LLM and "open in ChatGPT/Claude" page actions.
- `app/llms.txt`, `app/llms-full.txt` — machine-readable docs for LLMs.
- `app/md/[[...slug]]` — raw Markdown for a page (backs the copy/view actions).
- `app/api/search` — fumadocs search index.

Internal MDX links are root-relative (e.g. `/user-guide`); Next's `basePath` adds the
`/docs` prefix at render time.
