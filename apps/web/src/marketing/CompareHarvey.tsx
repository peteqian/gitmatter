          Harvey is a strong, mature suite for large firms — deep legal research, data-room-scale
          review, and enterprise integrations. gitmatter is a different shape: an auditable backend
          your own AI agent drives, on your own key, that you can run yourself. Here is the honest
          side-by-side.
